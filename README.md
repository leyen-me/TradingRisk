# Longbridge Securities Intraday Options Quantitative Trading System

## Introduction

This project is an intraday options quantitative trading system based on the Longbridge Securities API. It supports automated order placement, take-profit/stop-loss, risk control, and is suitable for highly liquid US stock options (e.g., TSLA.US).

## Entry

Find a suitable scalping strategy on TradingView, use TradingView alerts to send instructions (webhook), and the program will receive long/short signals and execute opening, take-profit, and stop-loss logic. My strategy is in the Pine folder, using an RSI reversal pattern. The drawback is that bottom-fishing may not catch the absolute bottom, and shorting may not catch the absolute top.

## Exit

Set take-profit and stop-loss immediately after opening a position. Both are set at a fixed 3% for closing, with a risk-reward ratio of 1:1, targeting 1-2 candlesticks.

If the option price moves sideways after buying (neither hitting take-profit nor stop-loss), the system will automatically close your position at 3:30 AM every day (even if neither take-profit nor stop-loss is triggered). This prevents indefinite holding, avoiding time value decay and overnight risk.
